This is just a fun sideproject I'm doing. 

Later on I'm planning on adding SVGs and more images to the project.

The Idea is to showcase some roman military equipment and tactics. 

Also disclaimer: I'm not a historian, just a nerd, so I'm not sure if everything will be 100% accurate, rather I doubt it will be so please don't take this as a historical source.

This project is running Next 13 app directory, React, and TailwindCSS. Also framer motion will be featured heavily.
