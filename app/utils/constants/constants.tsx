    'Lorica Segmentata': {
      image: Lorica,
      description:
        'The lorica segmentata, also called lorica lamminata, is a type of personal armour that was used by soldiers of the Roman army, consisting of metal strips fashioned into circular bands, fastened to internal leather straps. The lorica segmentata has come to be viewed as symbolic of the Roman legions in popular culture. The tendency to portray Roman legionaries clad in this type of armour often extends to periods of time that are too early or too late in history',
      name: "In Latin, the name lorica segmentata translates to 'segmented cuirass'. However, this name was not given to the armor by the Romans. Instead, it was given by scholars in the 16th century. Despite the lack of knowledge on the Roman name for the armor, scholars can make educated guesses on the Roman name. It is obvious the name had the word lorica in its name. However, the following part of the name is unknown. Some scholars believe that the name was lorica lamminata. This theory is based of the fact that the Romans referred to sheets of metal as lamina, although no firm evidence for any theory regarding the name of the armor currently exists.",
      history:
        "Despite the armor being commonly associated with the Romans, it was used by other civilizations before the Romans. The armor was originally used by the Parthians and possibly the Dacians, Scythians, or Sarmatians before the Romans used it. Some sets of armor similar to the lorica segmentata dating back to the 4th century BC have been found in archaeological sites located in the steppe. Although the exact time at which the Romans adopted the armor remains unknown, it is possible that the lorica segmentata was introduced after Crassus' defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC. Another possibility is that the armor was adopted in 21 AD after the Revolt of Julius Sacrovir and Julius Florus. One form of the armor was used as early as 9 AD. Because the soldiers at the Battle of Teutoberg Forest wore the lorica segmentata, it must have been in use before 9 AD.",
        usage:"It is unclear who used this armor. On monuments, Auxilia are generally shown wearing mail, cuirasses, and carrying oval shields. Legionaries are depicted wearing the lorica segmentata and frequently carrying the curved rectangular shield. On this basis, it has been supposed that lorica segmentata was exclusively used by legionaries and praetorians. However, some historians consider Trajan's Column to be inaccurate as a historical source due to its inaccurate and stylized portrayal of Roman armor. These historians also say that 'it is probably safest to interpret the Column reliefs as 'impressions', rather than accurate representations.'"

    'Caligae': {
        image:Caligae,
        description:'Caligae (Latin; singular caliga) are heavy-soled hobnailed military sandal-boots that were worn as standard issue by Roman legionary foot-soldiers and auxiliaries, including cavalry. ',
        name:" Caligae (singular caliga) are heavy-duty, thick-soled openwork boots, with hobnailed soles. They were worn by the lower ranks of Roman cavalrymen and foot-soldiers, and possibly by some centurions. A durable association of caligae with the common soldiery is evident in the latter's description as caligati ('booted ones'). In the early 1st century AD, the soldiery affectionately nicknamed the two- or three-year-old Gaius 'Caligula' ('little boot'), because he wore a diminutive soldier's outfit, complete with small caligae. ",
        history:"Occasionally, hobnailed caligae must have proved inconvenient, especially on hard surfaces; Josephus describes the killing of a caliga-shod Roman centurion who had slipped on the Temple of Jerusalem's marble floor during an attack. Nevertheless, the design of the caliga allowed for its adjustment, which would have helped reduce chafing; it probably made an 'ideal marching boot', and the thunderous sound of an attack by a hobnailed army (caligati) must have been terrifying.",
        usage:"Caligae would have been cooler on the march than enclosed boots. In warm, Mediterranean climates, this may have been an advantage. In northern Britain's cold, wet climate, additional woven socks or raw wool wadding in winter may have helped insulate the feet, but caligae seemed to have been abandoned there by the end of the 2nd century AD, in favour of civilian-style 'closed boots' (carbatinae). By the late 4th century, this seems to have applied throughout the Empire. The emperor Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices (301 AD) includes set prices for footwear described as caligae, but with no hobnails, made for civilian men, women and children"

    'Scutum': {
        image:Scutum,
        description:"The scutum (Classical Latin: ['sku:t̪ʊ̃]; plural scuta) was a type of shield used among Italic peoples in antiquity, most notably by the army of ancient Rome starting about the fourth century BC. The Romans adopted it when they switched from the military formation of the hoplite phalanx of the Greeks to the formation with maniples (Latin: manipuli). In the former, the soldiers carried a round shield, which the Romans called a clipeus. In the latter, they used the scutum, which was larger. Originally it was oblong and convex, but by the first century BC it had developed into the rectangular, semi-cylindrical shield that is popularly associated with the scutum in modern times. This was not the only kind the Romans used; Roman shields were of varying types depending on the role of the soldier who carried it. Oval, circular and rectangular shapes were used throughout Roman history. ",
        name:'Scutum simply means Shield in Latin and therefore that is where the name originates from. A different shield called Clipeus was used before the adoption of the scutum, that one however came from the Greek city states at the time and was oval instead of the scutums more rectangular shape.',
        history:"Sometime in the early fourth century BC, the Romans changed their military tactics from the hoplite phalanx to the manipular formation, which was much more flexible. This involved a change in military equipment. The scutum replaced the clipeus. Some ancient writers thought that the Romans had adopted the maniples and the scutum when they fought against the Samnites in the first or second Samnite War (343-341 BC, 327-304 BC). However, Livy did not mention the scutum being a Samnite shield and wrote that the oblong shield and the manipular formation were introduced in the early 4th century BC, before the conflicts between the Romans and the Samnites. Plutarch mentioned the use of the shield in a battle in 366 BC. Couissin notes archaeological evidence shows that the scutum was in use among Italic peoples long before the Samnite Wars and argues that it was not obtained from the Samnites.",
        usage:"According to Polybius, the scutum gave Roman soldiers an edge over their Carthaginian enemies during the Punic Wars, 'Their arms also give the men both protection and confidence, which they owed to the size of the shield'. The shape of the scutum allowed packed formations of legionaries to overlap their shields to provide an effective barrier against projectiles. The most novel (and specialised, for it afforded negligible protection against other attacks) use was the testudo (Latin for 'tortoise'), which added legionaries holding shields from above to protect against descending projectiles (such as arrows, spears, or objects thrown by defenders on walls).

    'Galea': {
        image:Galea,
        description:"A galea , from Greek γαλέη, galéē, 'weasel, marten') was a Roman soldier's helmet. Some gladiators, specifically myrmillones, also wore bronze galeae with face masks and decorations, often a fish on its crest. The exact form or design of the helmet varied significantly over time, between differing unit types, and also between individual examples, pre-industrial production was by hand, so it is not certain to what degree there was any standardization even under the Roman Empire. ",
        name:"A galea , from Greek γαλέη, galéē, 'weasel, marten')",
        history:" Originally, Roman helmets were influenced by the neighboring Etruscans, people who utilised the 'Nasua' type helmets. The Greeks in the south also influenced Roman design in its early history  The primary evidence is scattered archaeological finds, which are often damaged or incomplete. There are similarities of form and function between them. ",
        usage:"Some of the helmets used by legionaries had a crest holder. The crests were usually made of plumes or horse hair. While the fur is usually red, the crests possibly occurred in other colors, like yellow, purple and black, and possibly in combinations of these colors such as alternating yellow and black. Gladiators such as the samnis and the hoplomachus also probably wore large feathered crests. There is some evidence (Vegetius writings and some sculptures) that legionaries had their crests mounted longitudinally and centurions had them mounted transversely. Crests may have been worn at all times by centurions in the early empire, including during battle, but legionaries, and centurions during other periods, probably wore crests only occasionally. "

    'Weaponry': {
        image:LegionaryWeaponry,
        description:"The weapon of choice of the Roman legions was the gladius, a short sword that was around half a metre in length. This weapon was very good for thrusting into the enemy as it was double sided. It was used during the later Roman Republic and throughout most of the Roman Empire. A pilum was a javelin which was carried by many of the frontline infantry units. They would launch it at the enemy before engaging in hand to hand combat. A pugio (dagger) was carried by all legionary infantry. It was around twenty centimetres in length and would be used in very close quarters when a soldier was for whatever reason unable to use his gladius. ",
        name:"Gladius is the general Latin word for 'sword'. In the Roman Republic, the term gladius Hispaniensis (Spanish sword) referred (and still refers) specifically to the short sword, 60 cm (24 inches) long, used by Roman legionaries from the 3rd century BC The term 'Pugio' is derived from the Latin word for dagger, which is 'pugnus'. Pugiones were first used during the 1st century BC, and became more common during the 1st century AD. The pilum (Latin: ['pi:ɫʊ̃]; plural pila) was a javelin commonly used by the Roman army in ancient times, the name pilum translates to javelin",
        history:"Gladius: According to Polybius, the sword used by the Roman army during the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, though deemed superior to the cumbersome Gallic swords, was mainly useful to thrust. These thrusting swords used before the adoption of the Gladius were possibly based on the Greek xiphos. Later, during the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, they found Hannibal's Celtiberian mercenaries wielding swords that excelled at both slashing and thrusting. A text attributed to Polybius describes the adoption of this design by the Romans even before the end of the war, which canonical Polybius reaffirms by calling the later Roman sword gladius hispaniensis in Latin and iberiké machaira in Greek. It is believed Scipio Africanus was the promoter of the change after the Battle of Cartagena in 209 BC, after which he set the inhabitants to produce weapons for the Roman army. Pugio:  It seems likely that the pugio was intended as an auxiliary weapon, but its exact purpose for the soldier remains unknown. Officials of the empire took to wearing ornate daggers in the performance of their offices, and some would wear concealed daggers for defense in contingencies. The dagger was a common weapon of assassination and suicide; for example, the conspirators who stabbed Julius Caesar used pugiones. The pugio developed from the daggers used by the Cantabrians of the Iberian peninsula. Pilum: The pilum may have originated from an Italic tribe known as the Samnites. It also may have been influenced by Celtiberian and Etruscan weapons. The pilum may have derived from a Celtiberian weapon known as the falarica. Archaeological excavations have disclosed pila in tombs at the Etruscan city of Tarquinia. The oldest finds of pila are from the Etruscan settlements of Vulci and Talamone. The first identified written reference to the pilum comes from The Histories of Polybius. According to Polybius, more heavily armed soldiers of the Roman military used a type of spear called the hyssoí. This may have been the pilum. ",
        usage:"Gladius: The short-sword of the common Roman legionary was primarily used to thrust the enemy in the midsection, however if presented with the opportunity slashing at the kneecaps of an adversary was a common technique taught to the Roman soldier. Pugio: Since the pugio was a backup weapon to be used in extreme close combat where even the gladius was too long to be effectivly used, it was used in a similar fashion to the gladius. Pilum: The pilum was a javelin, and was used as such. It was thrown at the enemy before the legionaries engaged in hand to hand combat, the pilum itself would stick in the enemy shield and render both itself and the shield useless, the metal would bend and would be damaged to such a degree that getting it out of the shield proved very hard as well as throwing it back impossible."

        description:"A cingulum militare was a piece of ancient Roman military equipment in the form of a belt decorated with metal fittings, which was worn as a badge of military status by soldiers and officials. Many examples were made in the Roman province of Pannonia.",
        name:"The cingulum militare was known as the balteus until the third century AD when it began to be called the cingulum or cingulum militare. From the second century the term balteus was used to refer to the shoulder strap, or baldric, from which the sword was suspended.",
        history:"The word cingulum is used to define the belt from which the sword hanged. However, its original name was probably balteus, not cingulum. Maybe only from the 2nd century AD the belt became the cingulum, while balteus was used to define the baldric to hang the sword, crossing the soldier's chest from the right shoulder to the left hip, so introducing a new military fashion, fashion which didn't replace the previous one, but that went alongside it for a long period of time: visual sources show very clearly that hanging the sword from the belt was widely used until 3rd century and beyond.",
        usage:"The cingulum militare was used in conjunction with the helmet (galea), the shield (scutum), the overall armor on the upper body (lorica hamata), a dagger (pugio), and a sword (gladius)."
